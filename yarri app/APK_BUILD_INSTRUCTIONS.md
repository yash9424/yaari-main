# ✅ Android App Build Instructions

## Current Status:
- ✅ Android project created and configured
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Back button navigation implemented
- ✅ Safe area support added
- ✅ Gradle and build files configured

## Issue:
Java 21 is installed but Android Gradle Plugin requires Java 17 for optimal compatibility.

## Solution - Build APK Using Android Studio:

### Step 1: Open Android Studio
1. Launch Android Studio
2. Click "Open" or "Open an Existing Project"
3. Navigate to: `C:\Users\dell\Desktop\dating-app-Yaari\android`
4. Click "OK"

### Step 2: Wait for Gradle Sync
- Android Studio will automatically sync Gradle
- This may take 5-10 minutes on first run
- Wait for "Gradle sync finished" message

### Step 3: Build APK
1. Click **Build** menu
2. Select **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)**
3. Click **Build APK(s)**
4. Wait for build to complete (2-5 minutes)

### Step 4: Locate APK
- APK location: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- Android Studio will show a notification with "locate" link
- Click "locate" to open the folder

### Step 5: Install on Device
**Option A - USB:**
1. Enable Developer Options on phone
2. Enable USB Debugging
3. Connect phone via USB
4. In Android Studio, click green "Run" button
5. Select your device

**Option B - APK File:**
1. Copy `app-debug.apk` to your phone
2. Open the APK file
3. Allow installation from unknown sources
4. Install

## Alternative: Install Java 17
If you prefer command line build:
1. Download JDK 17: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17
2. Install JDK 17
3. Set JAVA_HOME to JDK 17 path
4. Run: `cd android && gradlew.bat assembleDebug`

## Features in the App:
✅ Login with phone number
✅ OTP verification  
✅ Language & gender selection
✅ User list with random avatars
✅ Call history
✅ Transaction history
✅ Customer support
✅ Edit profile
✅ Android back button navigation (A→B→Back→A)
✅ Safe area support for notch/camera
✅ Fully responsive design

## After Code Changes:
```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync android
```
Then rebuild in Android Studio.

**Recommended:** Use Android Studio for building as it handles all Java/Gradle compatibility automatically.
