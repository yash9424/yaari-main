## üîë Key Points:

### What Happens When User Ends Call:

1. **User clicks "End Call"**
   - Socket emits `end-call` event to other user
   - Closes own video/audio tracks
   - Leaves Agora channel
   - Clears session data
   - Returns to user list

2. **Other User Receives `call-ended` Event**
   - Closes video/audio tracks automatically
   - Leaves Agora channel automatically
   - Clears session data automatically
   - Returns to user list automatically
   - **NO manual action needed**

---

## üìä Expected Behavior:

| Action | User Who Ends Call | Other User |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Click End Call | ‚úÖ Returns to user list | ‚úÖ Auto returns to user list |
| Video/Audio Tracks | ‚úÖ Closed | ‚úÖ Auto closed |
| Agora Channel | ‚úÖ Left | ‚úÖ Auto left |
| Session Data | ‚úÖ Cleared | ‚úÖ Auto cleared |
| Manual Action | ‚úÖ Required (click button) | ‚ùå Not required (automatic) |

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting:

### Other user's call doesn't end:
1. Check browser console for socket events
2. Verify server.js is running
3. Check server logs: "Call ended, notifying other user"
4. Ensure both users are connected to socket

### Call ends but doesn't navigate:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify router.push('/users') is called
3. Check if /users route exists

### Both users stuck on call screen:
1. Refresh both browsers
2. Restart server.js
3. Clear session storage
4. Check socket connection
